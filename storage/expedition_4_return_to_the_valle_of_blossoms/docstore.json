He stays behind with the (so far) unnamed Queen of Flowers for two weeks. She apparently holds special interest in the dwarven kind? Speaks much about love, and some about her previous dwarf consort \u2013killed by the swift hands of the Trifecta during expedition #1. Was character of great import in the area, or sometime in the past? Implied to expedition party that \u201cQuen\u201d was possible name of Queen. Flower Queen perhaps also character of great import to region in the past. Passing of time in this realm/land is highly unclear, especially to its inhabitants. Have been here for \u201call time\u201d?\n\nDuring his stay, Grolsch learns of some lower levels beyond and under Queen\u2019s castle. Sees great opportunity in making floating valley dimension a Trifectan outpost in future. However, as will be seen, this plan is foiled for the time being. As agreed as payment for his prolonged stay in Valley, our man Grolsch is gifted a reward: A golden \u201cSword of Love\u201d. It is soon after deftly be employed as an instrument of the Trifectan cause. The Queen\u2019s starts to imply that two weeks company is not enough, and not enough people. It becomes increasingly clear Queen will try and force entire expedition party to stay in \u201cValley of Flowers\u201d and \u201clove forever\u201d. Her motivations thus highly suspicious and unclear.\n\nOur Grolsch man clevery realises her ploy: Queen is smartly outmanoeuvred in the planning of a \u201cparty\u201d for the return of the Trifectan soldiers. Traps, tools and tricks are laid for them to use in the coming inevitable fight/takeover/escape. Trifectan expedition party return to Valley as planned, bar noisy saxophonist. Grolsch cleverly orchestrates the \u201cwelcoming party\u201d, in which gifts are given by the Queen. Local fisherman, serving the dinner, was meanwhile convinced by our comrades to put blue liquid in fish for Queen: Apparently the coloured liquids represent facets of the Queen. So too are the Valley\u2019s inhabitants\u2019 facets of the Queen\u2019s persona: Regret, anger, sadness? Queen apparently clings only to love/joy, suppressing all else into these living(?) personas in village. Flower Queen ingests blue liquid through served fish. Has limited effect. Is however filled with intense regret/sadness, and through this also great distraught. Calls angrily out for the culprit: Local fisherman is named and detained, while Trifectan part is sent to Queen\u2019s castle, for safekeeping.\n\nThe party breaks formation and ends the charade/farce \u2013 attacks green-faceted children/family, filling their bellies with blue liquid in fountain. Children undisciplined and clearly unfit for combat. They are swiftly dealt with/exposed to effective torture. Parent\u2019s whiny, feigning real individuals. We slaughter children/constructs, bellies full of blue liquid. This harms queen, colouring her skin and further weakening her composure.\n\nQueen becomes furious, and our Trifectan Company handily dispatch of more Queen Constructs nearby. Queen is mocked for obvious weakness, as we shout her apparent name \u201cQuen\u201d. Queen rambles about having been left/left behind by someone. However, when Queen\u2019s weak morale has worn down, she says she is not actually this \u201cQuen\u201d. Apparently \u201cQuen\u201d is some master/husband/friend/colleague who she holds anger towards. However, \u201cQuen\u201d is NOT character who left her behind and caused intense sadness.\n\nPerhaps Queen of Love was not loved.\n\nIn the fray of combat, weak-willed blue fisherman-construct is convinced to kill himself for our Great Trifectan Cause.", "doc_id": "54c4e880-d600-48a6-926d-75f1e296554c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0e1bcb65c900fd7e35fecccac105592f8a135d6d361584dc6dbd2598161240f4", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3679}, "relationships": {"1": "9ffbb51f-3131-4c24-beb3-d86dc4a85353", "3": "e3036b59-5ae4-4994-ad97-74eef76ebdeb"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3036b59-5ae4-4994-ad97-74eef76ebdeb": {"__data__": {"text": "and further weakening her composure.\n\nQueen becomes furious, and our Trifectan Company handily dispatch of more Queen Constructs nearby.

This further enhances Flower Queen\u2019s weakness. Eventually, she implodes(?) through her sadness, bringing down pandemonium on Flower Realm. It\u2019s origin: Below Queen\u2019s castle. Some other powerful creature is awoken. Probably creature monster is real manifestation of her rage/fury. Pandemonium quickly destroys Valley of Flowers, leaving it an inferno. The Trifectan party bravely escapes, leaving behind a broken realm. Probably, Queen\u2019s entity of rage now resides in realm, possibly possessing great powers. This makes realm, at present, unfit for a Trifectan Forward Operating Base, at no fault of the expedition party.\n\nUnclear if awoken rage entity has ability to escape/leave realm. Future scouts should investigate with caution. Further, changes in light emitting from mountain in future should be considered a possible great danger. Enter with great caution \u2013 probably best when more knowledge of area and this \u201cQuen\u201d is gathered.\n\nWritten by Timou Grolsch, Keeper of the Sword of Love, Proud Rail Worker, Loyal servant of The Trifecta.", "doc_id": "e3036b59-5ae4-4994-ad97-74eef76ebdeb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2cdba14a0dd228b828295d720412d7e6a1d2d5294d7e1fbbddd63e9905e1befb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 2988, "end": 4722}, "relationships": {"1": "9ffbb51f-3131-4c24-beb3-d86dc4a85353", "2": "54c4e880-d600-48a6-926d-75f1e296554c"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
