# Spike
Place of birth: Soskni
High-Elf Male
1.95cm tall
High-Elf, Fighter.
Spike grew up in Soskni, he does not know the exact location, and he does not care. With only fractions of memory of his family, he still does not care or seek to know who they are.
Spike attended Tamburn School of Sophisticated Elven Magi, but did not finish his studies.
Since leaving Tamburn it is unknown what Spike was doing in Soskni before entering the Line.
