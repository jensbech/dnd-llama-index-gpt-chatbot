# NAME: Thaddeus Tinfoyle
Class: CG Divination Wizard
Place of birth: Soskni
Human Male
Description: Thaddeus Tinfoyle is a human divination wizard in his late forties. He's mainly self-taught, owing to an (un)healthy distrust of authorities. After many lonely years under the radar, in the lamplit back-alley taverns of Soskni, moving amongst the city's conspiratorial rejects and doomsday prophets, he has recently joined the expedition to Stormfyord in order to shake off his imagined pursuers and escape the crushing weight of the metropolis.
This may or may not have been a terrible idea.
