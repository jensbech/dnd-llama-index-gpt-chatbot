# The Tavern-keep
Zagog
No expedition can be successful without a well fed worker. The ancient and obsessive half-orc Zagog ensures that only the finest dining is available to the weary workers and soldiers at Stone-upon-hill. Her kitchen staff consists of a trio of young dwarves who scurry about as she shouts and curses, wheeling herself around in a steam-powered chair. The true reason for her employment is her aptitude for the brewing of alcohol. An artificer by trade, she is rumoured to have studied amongst the gnomes, perfecting a particular brand of mulled mead - Glaagg.
