Kazar Calendar
A list of important dates pertaining to the dawn of the Trifecta.

Note on the Calendar. PT is short for Post Trifecta, and designates the five decades that have passed since the Trifecta established themselves. BT is short for Before Trifecta and references the simple, quaint days before the unification of Kazar.
