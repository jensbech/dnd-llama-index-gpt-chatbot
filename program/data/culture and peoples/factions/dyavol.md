The Dâ€™Yavol
The Secret Police, rumoured to be based in Soskni, a splinter regiment of The Northbound Guard. They report exclusively to the Trifecta themselves and are feared by any sane citizen. Misbehaving children are often frightened with gruesome tales of what the D'Yavol will do to them if they don't behave.
They ensure the Trifecta's laws are upheld, and those who would let secrets from the factories escape to foreign benefactors often disappear and are never seen again. A detailed symbol of a wolf's head carved upon their door - the only known insignia of the D'Yavol.

"No matter how far your run or where you hide,
ultimately even the most fervent will capitulate
and the D'yavol will send your soul to Yakkavad"
- Rough translation of hafling children's song
