River of Gold
Do not underestimate the River of Gold based on its humble exteriors, where it sits on the seaside in Old Soskni
An economy growing at the rate of the Trifectums' needs a steady flow of gold, and the hafling run bank River of Gold is the place any would-be entrepreneur first visits.
Seated in the centre of old Soskni, the River of Gold funnels money from all of Kazar into the capitol, ensuring work never slows on the Line.
So critical is the bank to the advancement of the Trifecta that their military is used as a threat towards any who would be unable to repay their debts. Even worse is the threat of a visit from the secret police, The Dâ€™Yavol.
