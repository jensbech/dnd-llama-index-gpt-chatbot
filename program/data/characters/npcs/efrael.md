One of the Trifecta, the most powerful individuals in Kazar. A founding member alongside Duke Burghoul the Wide and President-Elect Garold Lawson.

King of elves, thought to be immortal, he has reigned throughout all known history. Oddly enough, his son Prince Calder still retains the looks of a ten year old boy, despite having lived for centuries. They are seldom seen apart, always standing side by side, clad in brilliantly blue robes.

Rarely visits his homeland, the Groves of Yonder, leaving his people to their own devices. Famously convinced the spirits of the forest, The Yonderli, to make way for the Line in the year 20 PT, connecting humans and dwarven lands for the first time.

Is called Gel'dinion by his people, meaning "He who sleeps beneath a glass sky".
