Calder
Insignia of King Efrael and Calder, the Caldernian, the birth star of the prince, suspended above the First Tree

Son of King Efrael, Prince-in-waiting Calder retains the appearance of a ten year old boy, despite having lived for many hundreds of years. Few have heard him speak, and none have seen him unaccompanied by his stern father. Should his father pass away he would become one of the Trifecta.

He resides in Arc-upon-high and rarerly visits the Groves of Yonder.

On the day he war born, long long ago, a new star was sighted in the night sky. Druids celebrated is as a celestial blessing of the young prince, and the star was named in his honour. This star is symbolised in the royal insignia by the light above the First Tree. It is known as the Caldernian.

Following a solar eclipse in the year 45 PT, caused by the rarely sighted moon Krktmnnyr [kartemyr], the star of Prince Calder has since vanished from the night sky, causing worried murmurs in the more superstitious circles in Kazar.
