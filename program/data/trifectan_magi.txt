Trifectian Magi

Powerful faction seated in Soskni, charged with monitoring all uses of magic on the continent on behalf of The Trifecta. Their methods of recruitment are shrouded in secrecy, though certain mages are trained for service from an early age at the Tamburn School of Sophisticated Elven Magi.
All magic users are required to carry markings on their outer clothing designating which level of magic they have been permitted to use. Breaking the limit imposed by the Magi is said to have terrible consequences, and few magic users have ever dared to challenge their authority.
The only exemption is to druidic magic practiced within the Groves of Yonder. But druids caught practicing magic on the Line are immediately seized by the Trifectian Magi.
Current leader: High Magus Leyna Herun (High-elf)
