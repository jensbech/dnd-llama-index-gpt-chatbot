# NAME: Aburaguzgul
Half-orc artificer
Place of birth: Dwarven Breeding Pits
Gender: Female
2,10+ meters tall.
The dwarves were looking to create new and better half-orcs in their breeding pits. It was good that they were strong. It made them good soldiers; but what if you could boost their intellect too? Then you really wanted good soldiers.
It did manage to bring the intellect up a bit, but that doesn't necessarily mean much for a half-orc, and overall, she, this first experiment, was seen as a failure, and no reports of similar experiments have occurred since.
The gnomes who first came by to look at the result called her an "aberration"—a word her half-orc kinsmen couldn't pronounce, so it quickly became Aburaguzgul, and among those who think that is too far (and there are many of them among half-orcs) she is called Abu, Abuguzgul, or Guzgul.
At well over 2 meters she is on par with most male half-orcs. But not everyone actually guesses that she belongs to one of the common races in Kazar. She looks like something from another world. Her skin is not the usual gray-green, but instead a kind of deep violet that is more reminiscent of a tiefling, but with a neon-pink tinge and a lot of bright toxic-green discolorations that make even tieflings disgusted by her. She has a strange, long and yellow tongue that she licks her mouth with when she is concentrating. She has six fingers on her good hand, four on her bad. Both atypically small hands for a half-orc; especially one of her height. In addition, she is weak and lacks the strength of her species. It was as if all the energy that was used in her creation to raise her intellect took away from her strength. Her arms are so far the same length, but not the same size, as her left arm is close to weathered. Her legs are the only thing that feels fairly normal. She has a long, slightly crooked face marked by two fangs from underminers like other half-orcs; but one is blunt and flat and the other is spherical. One of her eyes is golden, the other blood red.
It was clear from the start. She was a scumbag. And absolutely no super-soldier to bolster the ranks of Duke Burghoul's army. Instead, she was sent to the mines, like so many others before her. Sent into the mines to be forgotten. Sent to the mines to die. It was what everyone expected from this weak bastard.
Die, she didn't, but she was forgotten. After many years in the mines, she suddenly appeared on The Line in an engine room, where she was seen throwing her battered body around in the large steam engines, which she kept squeaky clean and in tip top condition with strange devices and dummies that don't quite look like on what the other mechanics use. She is frowned upon by both travelers on the mighty steam singers and by many other mechanics, but the head of her departments, the gnome Blinkey Tinkermouth, has a sense of her peculiar disposition and her atypical gadgets and knick-knacks, and is fond of his bastard of a mechanic.
However, he didn't get to keep her forever, because now she has heard that they are looking for people to go further north. And since it doesn't seem like many other than Blinkey will miss her, I guess it's just a matter of leaving. Who knows what knick-knacks you can come up with up there?

# NAME: Timou Grolsch
Affiliation: The Trifecta
Fighter
Male dwarf 
Description: The Grolsch are Trifectan middle class loyals who’s sweat, blood and craftsmanship are literally part of The Line.
Although Timou is a Grolsch of no particular importance, he was in recent years sent to Soskni to train as a fighter (Runic Knight). Having a Grolsch formally trained previously unheard of, however three reasons drove the family to invest in his education.
Scores of his siblings have died from some work-, gamble- or squabble related incidents along The Line. This is an ongoing threat to the family line.
Timou is well known for his work ethics, clear intentions and unwavering decision making. He is an uncomplicated young dwarf who shows up on time and puts in the work.
“Stay true to the Trifecta, procreate, and provide opportunity for your future. In hundred years, a Grolsch will Sing on The Line …"
Tawny Grolsch’s fireside story In grandfather Tawny Grolsch’s fireside story.
Stonemaid ‘The Proud’ Grolsch was made responsible for showing Bourghoul the Wide northerngoing work expansions on The Line in 12PT. Bourghoul gave her a shiny golden coin for the trouble, now an heirloom in Timou’s possession. The truth of the story is of little importance - it fills Timou with courage and purpose as he now travels from Soskni and northwards to the Expedition.
And Timou sings for the Trifecta…

# NAME: Thaddeus Tinfoyle
Class: CG Divination Wizard
Place of birth: Soskni
Human Male
Description: Thaddeus Tinfoyle is a human divination wizard in his late forties. He's mainly self-taught, owing to an (un)healthy distrust of authorities. After many lonely years under the radar, in the lamplit back-alley taverns of Soskni, moving amongst the city's conspiratorial rejects and doomsday prophets, he has recently joined the expedition to Stormfyord in order to shake off his imagined pursuers and escape the crushing weight of the metropolis.
