Experience point guide

For each expedition you venture out on your experience grows!

Experience points are counted in a different manner in Kazar. A single point is worth considerably more and indicates a dramatic foray into the wilderness.

The more dangerous the Expedition the greater the chance the reward will be higher than a single point. Failing to achieve any objectives during an Expedition could mean not receiving an experience point upon return.

Characters that fall behind on XP can benefit from joining higher level characters on more dangerous missions.

All characters start at level 1 with one experience point - what they know from life so far. Experience points stack.

Level 1: 1 XP
Level 2: 2 XP
Level 3: 4 XP
Level 4: 8 XP
Level 5: ???
