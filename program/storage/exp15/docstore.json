The castle was shaped like a dwarven burial urn.On the entrance door was written:King's Tomb - May the one who unites the family find peaceThere was a hole shaped like each necklace with the words \"son's heart - daughter's heart\" (the necklaces are heart-shaped).The first room was a long and dangerous trap corridor with swords, knives, and falling stones. Everyone lost a lot of health and used a lot of magic (but not more than allowed, Super Magnus).The traps seemed to be controlled by flying blue dwarf faces (which might still be somewhere in the castle).GuzGuz made the traps stop by opening the door at the end of the corridor.We rested in the corridor when the traps stopped.Afterward, we went upstairs to a grand hall.There were dwarf-like skeletal guards listening to Snella and Triz, wearing the necklaces (and Figma's dwarf crown). They didn't harm us.Snella, Triz, Figma, and Helmut went up to a plateau at the end of the grand hall. There was a dwarven chest.On it was written:This resting place is dedicated to King Thyn Hrakk, who still dreamsTo a new faith, you led our peopleChosen interpreter of the gods of skaldsBut the quest for the treasures in Kuld-NoroghAwoke the anger of the AncientsOur dream of the North forever weakenedTheir blood our life-giftMay your sleep be eternal, beloved kingMay your children be with you foreverMay our people be forgivenInside the chest was a royal necklace. Snella and Triz combined their necklaces with the new one. Triz put it on. It was the Hrakk Family Jewel.Snella also found a map showing that a castle called Findal (Wizard's Castle? Sunken Ruins?) was south of a castle called Kuld-Norogh (Troll Bridge Castle? Black Marrow?).Meanwhile, GuzGul explored an open sarcophagus elsewhere in the grand hall. There were three petrified dwarf men in front of it. One of them held a tablet that said:A curse? Like the one in Black Marrow? Should the concubine be buried separately?And then, in hurried handwriting: She's not dead. She's not...So the concubine might still be here.We searched the room and found the concubine, who was a medusa.She was hostile and dangerous, quickly turning Snella into stone through a mirror.Eventually, Helmut also turned to stone.But in the end, we managed to kill the concubine while the horn was sounding. We collected a dwarf statue, Stone-Helmut, and Stone-Snella in the Bag of Holding.And we ran out. There was a door in the hall that we didn't manage to open.As Triz left the castle with the crown and jewel necklace, the castle sank along with the burial mounds and everything else in the ground.It doesn't seem possible to bring it up again. The curse appears to be broken. The plain no longer drives people insane.GuzGuz wants to know what was behind that door.The dwarf-turned-to-stone man is standing in the tavern now.If someone can turn people from stone back to normal, that would be great. Then we'll get Snella and Helmut back.And we can talk to the old, old stone dwarf.", "doc_id": "a3c60240-efe6-46b7-b35a-cba41f4275ad", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ee642a53feb4155816112113453fe20c80f98a0fa19d42ec23199e77656385cb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3155}, "relationships": {"1": "00d1aec6-47a2-402f-b4fd-9b2107d9e72f"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
