We arrived at the wilderness, a large circular area covered in blue heather that resembles the heather in the forest and appears normal upon closer inspection. The boundary between the wilderness and the forest is sharp and seems artificial. Upon entering the wilderness, some members (likely those with weaker psyches) were affected by various magical effects. Figma ate soil and moss, Dwyghte was paralyzed, and Mrondi`r babbled incoherently. All three seemed very frightened. The effects subsided after about ten minutes. We left the horses in the forest as we deemed it unlikely for them to withstand the magical effects. Sneaking as a group towards the center of the wilderness, we noticed some elevations in the terrain. Although our attempt at sneaking was unsuccessful, we encountered no problems.Ruins in the Wilderness:Upon reaching the center, we came across this formation and checked the largest mound first (number 3 in the illustrations).Mounds seen from the front.Mrondir attempted to climb but slipped, dislodging the moss that covered a large door. On the door, there was a warning in an archaic dwarvish dialect. The lock proved impossible to pick. Instead, we investigated the small mound (number 1 in the illustration). We lifted a stone and discovered a sunken ruin. Inside, we found a dead dwarf with a dagger in its back, kneeling in front of an altar with a bronze statue (see illustration 3). The dwarf had been dead for a long time and had a key that we took with us. We dared not touch the statue, although it appeared valuable with gemstones and \"bleeding hands,\" long limbs, and a long beard (see illustration 4).With the new key, we returned to the main door and unlocked it. Going downstairs, we entered a large hall with three passages (see illustration 5).Mounds seen from the side.We explored the left and right corridors, which are symmetrical and have ten niches each containing a burial chest. The end chests are larger and positioned against the wall. We decided to open one chest at a time, but each time we opened one, another one would open automatically in a mirrored pattern. Inside the chests were angry dwarf skeletons, whom we fought relatively easily, as we only faced two at a time. Everything went well as we reached the end of the left corridor and discovered a crack in the wall, indicating a collapsed passage. Helmut cleared away the rubble and had a minor rockfall, but Mrondir and Figma proceeded inside. They encountered a very scary ghost-like flying monster. The foghorn sounded for the first time. Figma attempted to trap the ghost inside, but it passed right through the wall and attacked Helmut, causing him to fall unconscious. It was at this point that we realized we had underestimated the healing abilities of our company (the rest of the report is therefore described based on various accounts from non-unconscious group members). Partly due to the stress caused by the fog and partly due to fear of the ghost, we did not attempt to fight the enemy but instead tried to convince the monster to let us go. All attempts failed, but we believe it should be possible to communicate with it, although we were unable to do so ourselves. Mrondir chose to run away from the company but shot a few arrows, which appeared to get \"stuck in mid-air\" inside the creature's body. He should not receive credit for the rest of us making it out alive. The atmosphere was tense.

Maurice also fell unconscious. Dwyghte and Figma barely managed to bring out their respective bodies. The ghost accused someone of being a thief and scoundrel, indicating that something important had been stolen and mentioned a name (Rondir/Rondo?) while desiring the \"princess's inheritance\" to be returned, probably the reason for the haunting. It turned out that the ghost couldn't follow us out of the ruins. We barely escaped the fog. In summary, we believe there is one large chest and two small chests with unbeaten skeletons remaining. Furthermore, the small mound to the right and the central passage have not been explored.
