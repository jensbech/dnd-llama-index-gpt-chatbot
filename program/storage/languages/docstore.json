However, some things remain the same.GnomishConsidered by the bards as the most evocative of written languages, it is however rarely used by the general populace. Everyone knows a word or two of it, though, and most ancient records are written in this curious tongue. To think that the greatest invention of the gnomes was to be the most elegant language of them all!CommonSpoken by just about anyone across the many realms, it is said to be somewhat guttural and sharp, compared to the softer tones of Gnomish. It has a particular tonality, which non-native speakers refer to as \"sing-songy\".\"Jeg \u00f8nsker \u00e5 rulle for perception.\" (I wish to roll for perception. A common mix of gnomish and common words.)OrcishClose to Common, and clearly developed from the same dialect. Words are more clearly spoken, emphasising vowels.\"\u00c6 R\u00c6IGJE\" (I am furious)UndercommonA flamboyant and sharp language, with an almost melodic aspect. Rough to speak and listen to.\"Forzt\u00e5r du ingenting? Jeg errr Prrrins Ycaaauron!\" (Don't you understand anything? I am Prince Ycaron!)ElvishSimiliar in many ways to Common, but less sharp.
