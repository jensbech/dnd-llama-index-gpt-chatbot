Breaking the limit imposed by the Magi is said to have terrible consequences, and few magic users have ever dared to challenge their authority.\nThe only exemption is to druidic magic practiced within the Groves of Yonder. But druids caught practicing magic on the Line are immediately seized by the Trifectian Magi.\nCurrent leader: High Magus Leyna Herun (High-elf)", "doc_id": "d4ea3f9c-82d6-46b3-a8f7-26df67ca9922", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5d40d6dd07e0f97acab0a60e96f15838cecbaa7bab797aaea2f2177dc85bf90e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 808}, "relationships": {"1": "fb664c8c-a9a5-4ae7-bdcc-eb119420c79b"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
