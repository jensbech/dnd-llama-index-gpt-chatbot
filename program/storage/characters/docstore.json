It was good that they were strong. It made them good soldiers; but what if you could boost their intellect too? Then you really wanted good soldiers.\nIt did manage to bring the intellect up a bit, but that doesn't necessarily mean much for a half-orc, and overall, she, this first experiment, was seen as a failure, and no reports of similar experiments have occurred since.\nThe gnomes who first came by to look at the result called her an \"aberration\"\u2014a word her half-orc kinsmen couldn't pronounce, so it quickly became Aburaguzgul, and among those who think that is too far (and there are many of them among half-orcs) she is called Abu, Abuguzgul, or Guzgul.\nAt well over 2 meters she is on par with most male half-orcs. But not everyone actually guesses that she belongs to one of the common races in Kazar. She looks like something from another world. Her skin is not the usual gray-green, but instead a kind of deep violet that is more reminiscent of a tiefling, but with a neon-pink tinge and a lot of bright toxic-green discolorations that make even tieflings disgusted by her. She has a strange, long and yellow tongue that she licks her mouth with when she is concentrating. She has six fingers on her good hand, four on her bad. Both atypically small hands for a half-orc; especially one of her height. In addition, she is weak and lacks the strength of her species. It was as if all the energy that was used in her creation to raise her intellect took away from her strength. Her arms are so far the same length, but not the same size, as her left arm is close to weathered. Her legs are the only thing that feels fairly normal. She has a long, slightly crooked face marked by two fangs from underminers like other half-orcs; but one is blunt and flat and the other is spherical. One of her eyes is golden, the other blood red.\nIt was clear from the start. She was a scumbag. And absolutely no super-soldier to bolster the ranks of Duke Burghoul's army. Instead, she was sent to the mines, like so many others before her. Sent into the mines to be forgotten. Sent to the mines to die. It was what everyone expected from this weak bastard.\nDie, she didn't, but she was forgotten. After many years in the mines, she suddenly appeared on The Line in an engine room, where she was seen throwing her battered body around in the large steam engines, which she kept squeaky clean and in tip top condition with strange devices and dummies that don't quite look like on what the other mechanics use. She is frowned upon by both travelers on the mighty steam singers and by many other mechanics, but the head of her departments, the gnome Blinkey Tinkermouth, has a sense of her peculiar disposition and her atypical gadgets and knick-knacks, and is fond of his bastard of a mechanic.\nHowever, he didn't get to keep her forever, because now she has heard that they are looking for people to go further north. And since it doesn't seem like many other than Blinkey will miss her, I guess it's just a matter of leaving. Who knows what knick-knacks you can come up with up there?\n\n", "doc_id": "b0fc4e52-71ab-4f8e-aea3-7eda3cfa93fc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2b67b3d66ea71bf1780e1404cfaf3f26d1129dd1ba09fbe2607f5fe32f332109", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3256}, "relationships": {"1": "af3bb4f2-82ef-4eba-806e-bf56b9c90acc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "35fc9a6f-ee68-4c6e-9cd0-6a679e9a6290": {"__data__": {"text": "Affiliation: The Trifecta\nFighter\nMale dwarf \nDescription: The Grolsch are Trifectan middle class loyals who\u2019s sweat, blood and craftsmanship are literally part of The Line.\nAlthough Timou is a Grolsch of no particular importance, he was in recent years sent to Soskni to train as a fighter (Runic Knight).
