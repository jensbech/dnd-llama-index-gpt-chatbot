Their methods of recruitment are shrouded in secrecy, though certain mages are trained for service from an early age at the Tamburn School of Sophisticated Elven Magi.All magic users are required to carry markings on their outer clothing designating which level of magic they have been permitted to use. Breaking the limit imposed by the Magi is said to have terrible consequences, and few magic users have ever dared to challenge their authority.The only exemption is to druidic magic practiced within the Groves of Yonder. But druids caught practicing magic on the Line are immediately seized by the Trifectian Magi.Current leader: High Magus Leyna Herun (High-elf)Tamburn School of Sophisticated Elven MagiThe school is well situated in New Soskni.Magical university in Soskni, run by the Trifectian Magi, specialising in awakening the dormant magical powers that reside in all high-elf children. Most students go on to work directly for the Trifectian Magi as enforcers and mage hunters.Admission is strict, accepting only 40 students every 45 years. The fee of attendance is extremely high, so the students are often from families belonging to high society. Occasionally they will admit orphans or elves from poorer families.Current headmaster: Zhagur Aucustin", "doc_id": "5b9895e4-2950-48dc-92d3-50418f36cc09", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b348071bd9ab4f3aa6c9ee1a79f2188ab5d88684eb67094349c392368d4c1579", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1401}, "relationships": {"1": "28ef6c7e-bf00-4f28-b943-0100ccd78ccd"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
