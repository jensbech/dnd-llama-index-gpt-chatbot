But this attitude alone is not enough to rid the people of Kazar of their ancient customs and beliefs.\n\nGenesis & Modern worship\nThe progenitor gods create Kazar - painter Ezeke Van Klemt, University of Zil \u2018a Zan - 14 PT\nAlthough the creation of the realm is usually attributed to Ceih\u00edr (Flamefather), Sruth (Roar of Water) and Anam (Dreamer), the progenitor Gods, rarely are these worshipped in name, as they are known to have abandoned the world in its youth and their tales are mostly lost to ancient myth.\nThe Chorus (The Nine Bards of Anam) are considered by most to have awoken the world, teaching the inhabitants their ways. Their departure, a tragedy known as the Betrayal, occurred when Yakkavad gave life to the Tieflings.\nIn addition to the Chorus exists the worship of the Dark Prince and the Smiling God, problematic beliefs which are widely shunned.\nEach deity represents one of the alignment choices you as a player has.\n\nLawful Good \u2013 The Sisters Za \u2013 The Truespoken\nGods of Honesty, believed to be three sisters who all speak and sing in tune. Their followers believe honesty in all things the greatest of virtues.

All who believe in joining the chorus after their death pray to Hildegard, making her the most popular of the Gods.\n\nChaotic Good \u2013 Jeroule \u2013 The Whimsical  \nA god who never plays in tune with others, but who creates beautiful harmonies that complement the others.

She is said to deliver divine judgement without mercy. Her symbol is emblazoned upon every court of law in Kazar. Many warriors ask her for guidance before battle.\n\nNeutral \u2013 Ramish \u2013 The Wavesinger\nGod of sea and wind, a deep voice which seldom heeds the needs or woes of the sailors who pray to him. An introverted God who never opens his eyes to his own actions. Some theologians consider his and Vallaka\u2019s parts similar to those of the progenitor gods Sruth and Ceih\u00edr \u2013 leading many to question if their existence is due to a mistranslation.\n\nChaotic Neutral \u2013 Vallaka - The Flamecaller\n\nBronze likeness of Vallaka the Flamecaller, official emblem of the Trifecta Line Company\n\nBelieved to have tamed the fires, but let them run free when Ramish refused her romantic advances.
