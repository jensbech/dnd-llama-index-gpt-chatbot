They are based on an island off the south coast of Kazar, owned by their aging founder Rak von Drek, descendant of one of the most pious and wealthy merchant families.\nMost renowned for having found a cure to the Zigzag Sickness which plagued several stations south of the Groves of Yonder in the 30's PT. Their vaccine was heralded as a miracle, their order now on the offical payroll of the Trifecta.\nCurrent leader: Emilia von Drek, daughter of Rak von Drek\n\n\nRiver of Gold\nDo not underestimate the River of Gold based on its humble exteriors, where it sits on the seaside in Old Soskni\nAn economy growing at the rate of the Trifectums' needs a steady flow of gold, and the hafling run bank River of Gold is the place any would-be entrepreneur first visits.\nSeated in the centre of old Soskni, the River of Gold funnels money from all of Kazar into the capitol, ensuring work never slows on the Line.\nSo critical is the bank to the advancement of the Trifecta that their military is used as a threat towards any who would be unable to repay their debts. Even worse is the threat of a visit from the secret police, The D\u2019Yavol.\nCurrent leader: Chief banker Manfried Ruben (Halfling)\n\n\nTamburn School of Sophisticated Elven Magi\nThe school is well situated in New Soskni.\nMagical university in Soskni, run by the Trifectian Magi, specialising in awakening the dormant magical powers that reside in all high-elf children. Most students go on to work directly for the Trifectian Magi as enforcers and mage hunters.\nAdmission is strict, accepting only 40 students every 45 years. The fee of attendance is extremely high, so the students are often from families belonging to high society. Occasionally they will admit orphans or elves from poorer families.\nCurrent headmaster: Zhagur Aucustin", "doc_id": "72370022-106a-4aa1-bf3f-4657b96f1a25", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9922ddeb95a1943a4a4724915a85e793d4b2017ecedf0e169d085bf51251d42b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1897}, "relationships": {"1": "dda5fd46-7cb3-49a4-aae7-d4fb228b9dd4"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
