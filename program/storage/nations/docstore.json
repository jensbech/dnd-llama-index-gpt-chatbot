Consisting of never-ending grassy plains, few visiting ships ever survive contact with the rural chiefs. Considered the birthplace of all humanity.Vicious and untameable.-------------FuhdainDominant worship: Church of the LifebringerOne of the oldest countries in the known world, The Republic of Fuhdain is proud and ambitious. Once it colonized Vergenwell, until its people finally rebelled, installing their own Emperor. Fuhdain desperately wishes to reclaim its former glory. The western coast and southern lands are bountiful, while the eastern shore, bordering on the Verganian straight, harbours mostly warships and collapsed bridges due to centuries of conflict with Vergenwell.Proud and ambitious, but decadent.-------------VergenwellVergenwell hosts the largest in navy in KazarDominant worship: Sword of the All-Judge, Church of the WavesingerThe Empire of Vergenwell is a small nation, neighbour to Fuhdain. Boasting a large navy, it nonetheless struggles to grow due in large to its ongoing war with Fuhdain, from which it earned its independence two hundred years ago.
