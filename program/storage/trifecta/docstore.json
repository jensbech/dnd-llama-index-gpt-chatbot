Rich merchants vie for the rights to assemble parts in their factories, though they are at all times monitored by representatives from the militaristic Trifecta Line Company.\n\nWhile the Trifecta themselves are the formal heads of the organisation, there exists a Ministry of Traffic staffed with their most loyal and experienced engineers who oversee the day to day business on the Line.\n\nOne of their chief pursuits is ensuring no rival nation understand the nature of their technology, which in turn has led to Steam Singer design becoming increasingly complex and obtuse - the newest Singers a mass og tangled metal and steel.\n\nAn entire regiment of the Northbound Guard is assigned to the Trifecta Line Company, known as Officers of the Line.\n\n\n", "doc_id": "b6a6c505-da4c-4d5e-a1b8-2757df7ecec6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "27da785070014651a31799d02a7eded44462369111bf1896b4bc079d5d28cabf", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1268}, "relationships": {"1": "0e416de3-7dab-4b98-88bb-7f30b011056b"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
