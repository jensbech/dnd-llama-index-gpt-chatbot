It constitutes both a county and a municipality. The municipality of Oslo had a population of 709,037 in 2022, while the city's greater urban area had a population of 1,064,235 in 2022,[14] and the metropolitan area had an estimated population of 1,546,706 in 2021.[15]\n\nDuring the Viking Age, the area was part of Viken. Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in 1040 under the name \u00c1nslo, and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada. The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, during the reign of King Christian IV, a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in honour of the king. It became a municipality (formannskapsdistrikt) on 1 January 1838. The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814\u20131905 union between Sweden and Norway. From 1877, the city's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage, a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities in 1897. In 1925, the city, after incorporating the village retaining its former name, was renamed Oslo. In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker, a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger, thus creating the modern, much larger Oslo municipality.\n\nOslo is the economic and governmental centre of Norway. The city is also a hub of Norwegian trade, banking, industry and shipping. It is an important centre for maritime industries and maritime trade in Europe. The city is home to many companies within the maritime sector, some of which are among the world's largest shipping companies, shipbrokers and maritime insurance brokers. Oslo is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission intercultural cities programme.\n\nOslo is considered a global city and was ranked \"Beta World City\" in studies carried out by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network in 2008.[16] It was ranked number one in terms of quality of life among European large cities in the European Cities of the Future 2012 report by fDi magazine.[17] A survey conducted by ECA International in 2011 placed Oslo as the second most expensive city in the world for living expenses after Tokyo.[18] In 2013 Oslo tied with the Australian city of Melbourne as the fourth most expensive city in the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)'s Worldwide Cost of Living study.[19] Oslo was ranked as the 24th most liveable city in the world by Monocle magazine.[20]\n\nOslo's population was increasing at record rates during the early 2000s, making it the fastest growing major city in Europe at the time.[21] This growth stems for the most part from international immigration and related high birth rates, but also from intra-national migration. By 2010 the immigrant population in the city was growing somewhat faster than the Norwegian population,[22] and in the city proper this had become more than 25% of the total population if the children of immigrant parents are included.[23]\nUrban region\n\nThe municipality of Oslo has a population of 702,543 as of 31 March 2022.[24] The urban area extends beyond the boundaries of the municipality into the surrounding county of Viken (municipalities of Asker, B\u00e6rum, Lillestr\u00f8m, Enebakk, R\u00e6lingen, L\u00f8renskog, Nittedal, Gjerdrum, Nordre Follo); the total population of this agglomeration was 1,064,235 in 2022.[14] The", "doc_id": "3a0c5602-2763-45bd-926b-c6bc5c5829fa", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ac095df26057ec521ef7bfad17066a797429aa499883da19be93ec18f48137ae", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3720}, "relationships": {"1": "5d0a80dd-7b2e-41e1-ba89-dd7910e1eeea", "3": "9cd74aa0-a6f1-441d-9cb4-5774a2ca4d09"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cd74aa0-a6f1-441d-9cb4-5774a2ca4d09": {"__data__": {"text": "part from international immigration and related high birth rates, but also from intra-national migration.

The urban municipality (bykommune) of Oslo and county (fylke) of Oslo are two parts of the same entity, making Oslo the only city in Norway where two administrative levels are integrated. Of Oslo's total area, 130 km2 (50 sq mi) is built-up and 9.6 km2 (3.7 sq mi) is agricultural. The open areas within the built-up zone amount to 22 km2 (8.5 sq mi).[25]\n\nThe city of Oslo was established as a municipality on 3 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). It was separated from the county of Akershus to become a county of its own in 1842. The rural municipality of Aker was merged with Oslo on 1 January 1948 (and simultaneously transferred from Akershus county to Oslo county). Furthermore, Oslo shares several important functions with Akershus county. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBergen (Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8b\u00e6\u0300r\u0261n\u0329] (listen)), historically Bj\u00f8rgvin, is a city and municipality in Vestland county on the west coast of Norway. As of 2021, its population is roughly 285,900.[2] Bergen is the second-largest city in Norway. The municipality covers 465 square kilometres (180 sq mi) and is on the peninsula of Bergenshalv\u00f8yen. The city centre and northern neighbourhoods are on Byfjorden, 'the city fjord', and the city is surrounded by mountains; Bergen is known as the \"city of seven mountains\". Many of the extra-municipal suburbs are on islands. Bergen is the administrative centre of Vestland county. The city consists of eight boroughs: Arna, Bergenhus, Fana, Fyllingsdalen, Laksev\u00e5g, Ytrebygda, \u00c5rstad, and \u00c5sane.\n\nTrading in Bergen may have started as early as the 1020s. According to tradition, the city was founded in 1070 by King Olav Kyrre and was named Bj\u00f8rgvin, 'the green meadow among the mountains'. It served as Norway's capital in the 13th century, and from the end of the 13th century became a bureau city of the Hanseatic League. Until 1789, Bergen enjoyed exclusive rights to mediate trade between Northern Norway and abroad and it was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s when it was overtaken by the capital, Christiania (now known as Oslo). What remains of the quays, Bryggen, is a World Heritage Site. The city was hit by numerous fires over the years.

The Bergen School of Meteorology was developed at the Geophysical Institute starting in 1917, the Norwegian School of Economics was founded in 1936, and the University of Bergen in 1946. From 1831 to 1972, Bergen was its own county. In 1972 the municipality absorbed four surrounding municipalities and became a part of Hordaland county.\n\nThe city is an international center for aquaculture, shipping, the offshore petroleum industry and subsea technology, and a national centre for higher education, media, tourism and finance. Bergen Port is Norway's busiest in terms of both freight and passengers, with over 300 cruise ship calls a year bringing nearly a half a million passengers to Bergen,[3] a number that has doubled in 10 years.[4] Almost half of the passengers are German or British.[4] The city's main football team is SK Brann and a unique tradition of the city is the buekorps. Natives speak a distinct dialect, known as Bergensk. The city features Bergen Airport, Flesland and Bergen Light Rail, and is the terminus of the Bergen Line. Four large bridges connect Bergen to its suburban municipalities.\n\nBergen has a mild winter climate, though with a lot of precipitation. From December to March, Bergen can, in rare cases, be up to 20 \u00b0C warmer than Oslo, even though both cities are at about 60\u00b0 North. The Gulf Stream keeps the sea relatively warm, considering the latitude, and the mountains protect the city from cold winds from the north, north-east and east.\nHistory\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Bergen.\nHieronymus Scholeus's impression of Bergen. The drawing was made in about 1580 and was published in an atlas with drawings of many different cities (Civitaes orbis terrarum).[5]\n\nThe city of Bergen was traditionally thought to have been founded by king Olav Kyrre, son of Harald Hardr\u00e5de in 1070 AD,[6] four years after the Viking Age in England ended with the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Modern research has, however, discovered that a trading settlement had already been established in the 1020s or 1030s.[7]\n\nBergen gradually assumed the function of capital of Norway in the early 13th century, as the first city where a rudimentary central administration was established. The city's cathedral was the site of the first royal coronation in Norway in the 1150s, and continued to host royal coronations throughout the 13th century. Bergenhus fortress dates from the 1240s and guards the entrance to the harbour in Bergen. The functions of the capital city were lost to Oslo during the reign of King Haakon V (1299\u20131319).\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, North German merchants, who had already been present in substantial numbers since the 13th century, founded one of the four Kontore of the Hanseatic League at Bryggen in Bergen. The principal export traded from Bergen was dried cod from the northern Norwegian coast,[8] which started around 1100. The city was granted a monopoly for trade from the north of Norway by King H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson (1217\u20131263).[9] Stockfish was the main reason that the city became one of North Europe's largest centres for trade.[9] By the late 14th century, Bergen had established itself as the centre of the trade in Norway.[10] The Hanseatic merchants lived in their own separate quarter of the", "doc_id": "111b3ab6-3b4e-4c99-bdea-51f80c62d00c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "744347ca536ef3c4e3a18538ddb81799e4c8bfe0335870d19d05fbfb651e3450", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 6612, "end": 10473}, "relationships": {"1": "5d0a80dd-7b2e-41e1-ba89-dd7910e1eeea", "2": "9cd74aa0-a6f1-441d-9cb4-5774a2ca4d09", "3": "6704375e-ea34-40f3-9f4b-11d738615f22"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6704375e-ea34-40f3-9f4b-11d738615f22": {"__data__": {"text": "Haakon V (1299\u20131319).\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, North German merchants, who had already been present in substantial numbers since the 13th century, founded one of the four Kontore of the Hanseatic League at Bryggen in Bergen.
