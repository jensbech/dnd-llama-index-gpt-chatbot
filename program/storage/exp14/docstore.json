Asked about Rondo\u2019s whereabouts, got vision of inhabited hill in lake outside. Must investigate.Ritz killed Quen, out of mercy. Puff shocked, but still alive. Almost agreed to come along to Stone-Upon-Hill when Ritz mentioned Aburaguzgul. Puff now recognized Ritz and Ignur. Attacked. Swallowed Ritz and forced a fight. Made Puff surrender after killing Carpet, but by then too late. Ritz dead. Puff not just stupid, but evil. No more mercy for Puff. Fog horn sounded, and Puff teleported away before we could land killing blow. Packed Ritz in Carpet and rode for home.
