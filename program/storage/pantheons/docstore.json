But this attitude alone is not enough to rid the people of Kazar of their ancient customs and beliefs.Genesis & Modern worshipThe progenitor gods create Kazar - painter Ezeke Van Klemt, University of Zil \u2018a Zan - 14 PTAlthough the creation of the realm is usually attributed to Ceih\u00edr (Flamefather), Sruth (Roar of Water) and Anam (Dreamer), the progenitor Gods, rarely are these worshipped in name, as they are known to have abandoned the world in its youth and their tales are mostly lost to ancient myth.The Chorus (The Nine Bards of Anam) are considered by most to have awoken the world, teaching the inhabitants their ways. Their departure, a tragedy known as the Betrayal, occurred when Yakkavad gave life to the Tieflings.In addition to the Chorus exists the worship of the Dark Prince and the Smiling God, problematic beliefs which are widely shunned.Each deity represents one of the alignment choices you as a player has.Lawful Good \u2013 The Sisters Za \u2013 The TruespokenGods of Honesty, believed to be three sisters who all speak and sing in tune. Their followers believe honesty in all things the greatest of virtues. Paladins and Clerics often follow their teachings.Neutral Good \u2013 Hildegard \u2013 The LifebringerWaker of the world, God of the new-born and God of death, Hildegard was said to have ascribed every beings\u2019 number of days.  All who believe in joining the chorus after their death pray to Hildegard, making her the most popular of the Gods.Chaotic Good \u2013 Jeroule \u2013 The Whimsical  A god who never plays in tune with others, but who creates beautiful harmonies that complement the others. Believed to be the God of independence and free spirit. Many of his tales involve his chaotic nature bringing happiness to others by accident.Lawful Neutral - Sublatti the Slayer \u2013 Bane of Yakkavad/The All-JudgeSublatti the Slayer defeats Yakkavad - Painted by First Judge Jada Cowl in 80 BTGod of justice, believed to have slain Yakkavad when he attempted to break from the chorus of the world. She is said to deliver divine judgement without mercy. Her symbol is emblazoned upon every court of law in Kazar. Many warriors ask her for guidance before battle.Neutral \u2013 Ramish \u2013 The WavesingerGod of sea and wind, a deep voice which seldom heeds the needs or woes of the sailors who pray to him. An introverted God who never opens his eyes to his own actions. Some theologians consider his and Vallaka\u2019s parts similar to those of the progenitor gods Sruth and Ceih\u00edr \u2013 leading many to question if their existence is due to a mistranslation.Chaotic Neutral \u2013 Vallaka - The FlamecallerBronze likeness of Vallaka the Flamecaller, official emblem of the Trifecta Line CompanyBelieved to have tamed the fires, but let them run free when Ramish refused her romantic advances. A volatile trickster who might as soon kill you as spare your life. She is considered the mother of all steam; her likeness is often engraved upon Steam Singers on the Line. As with Ramish, certain scholars believe her to be a continuation or mistranslation of Ceih\u00edr,Lawful Evil \u2013 Cult of the Dark PrinceWorshippers of ambition, who follow ancient texts referring to a victory over the ancient Gods by the Auburn Prince. Considered heretics for proclaiming the Gods as having been slain long ago.Neutral Evil \u2013 Yakkavad the Betrayer/The True SingerRebellious God who wished to create in his own image.
