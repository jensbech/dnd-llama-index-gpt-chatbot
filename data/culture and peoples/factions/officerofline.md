Officers of the Line

Hybrid military regiment which is both an offshoot of The Northbound Guard while being simultaneously directly employed by Trifecta Line Company.

One of the proudest regiments of the Trifecta in Kazar, only the best officers are selected to work on the Line, riding the Steam Singers up and down the track, ensuring the safety of both cargo and passengers alike.

While the officers who ride the Steam Singers themselves are proud and well dressed, many of those posted to far away stations in dusty frontier towns grumble that this was not the honorable position they had expected.
