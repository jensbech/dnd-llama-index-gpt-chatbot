THIS DOCUMENT LISTS AND DESCRIBES THE BORDERING NATIONS OF THE TRIFECTA.

The Trifecta considers itself the very centre of Kazar, but to the south and west lie other considerable nations.

-------------

Chytyr
Dominant worship: None, though many tribes swear fealty to Jeroule and Yakkavad
A massive landmass which knows no end, Chytyr is a nation in name only. Consisting of never-ending grassy plains, few visiting ships ever survive contact with the rural chiefs. Considered the birthplace of all humanity.
Vicious and untameable.

-------------

Fuhdain
Dominant worship: Church of the Lifebringer
One of the oldest countries in the known world, The Republic of Fuhdain is proud and ambitious. Once it colonized Vergenwell, until its people finally rebelled, installing their own Emperor. Fuhdain desperately wishes to reclaim its former glory. The western coast and southern lands are bountiful, while the eastern shore, bordering on the Verganian straight, harbours mostly warships and collapsed bridges due to centuries of conflict with Vergenwell.
Proud and ambitious, but decadent.

-------------

Vergenwell
Vergenwell hosts the largest in navy in Kazar
Dominant worship: Sword of the All-Judge, Church of the Wavesinger
The Empire of Vergenwell is a small nation, neighbour to Fuhdain. Boasting a large navy, it nonetheless struggles to grow due in large to its ongoing war with Fuhdain, from which it earned its independence two hundred years ago. Religion and state are closely intertwined.
Militaristic and zealous, but foolhardy.
