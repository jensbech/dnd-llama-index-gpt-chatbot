Treesinger
A Treesinger belongs to a small, secluded society which seldom interacts with the world of technology on its doorstep

You have been raised in the most secluded forests of the Groves of Yonder in Kazar in a small commune, taught the ancient ways of the wood-elves. As a Treesinger you have spent your formative years communing with nature in solitude, trying to understand the The Yonderli and the nature they inhabit.

Personality Trait, Ideal, Bond and Flaw should somehow be linked to your time as a warden of the forests and the few, but important, encounters you have had along the way.
