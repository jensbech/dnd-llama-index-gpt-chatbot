No effort in the history of Kazar has claimed as large a work force as the expansion of the fabled Line, stretching from Arc-Upon-High to Stormfyord. Thousands have been worked to the bone alongside its many stations and villages, entire local communities built around the hard but profitable work. As a Line Worker you belong to the blue collar society in Kazar, where hammer and steel are king.
