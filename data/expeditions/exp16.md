Expedition party:

Thaddeus Tinfoyle (Chronicler)
Dwyghte Lifebringer
Antonio Juan Deras
Fiona Halv-Firs
Results:

Arrived at town of Bucklehill early to investigate claims of children w/ zigzag sickness, made by Clara, acquaintance of Dwyghte from decades ago when fighting original outbreak of sickness. Spoke w/ Lifebringer’s paladin friend Torgir, now innkeeper. Learned Clara disappeared ca. 1 week ago. Searched her room, found signs of break in, contents of one drawer recently removed. Dilapitated mansion with clear view towards room, made Juan Deras invisible and sent to investigate. Found five horses and tracks indicating recent occupation.

Initiated interviews w/ villagers, assisted by Halv-Firs’ new intimidating attitude after recent trauma and dissociation + Juan Deras clearly having childhood connection to town (recognized as Antonio Splat). Learned following:

Two infected children + families recently left for “vacation” to Soskni (infection not known to villagers).
Local schoolteacher paid by Rex Sanitem to allow “clean up” of infected children and close school off from everybody
Two weapon salesmen from Vergenwell recently sold modern firearms to five strangers.
Female white D’yavol dragonborn w/ gold chain investigating salesmen, threatened us to stay out of it.
Went to investigate school, broke padlock to enter. Heard muffled voices behind semi-secret door, leading to basement. Found two half elves w/ strange masks holding knife to throat of Clara. Large copper tank in room w/ signs of leakage. Purple zigzag pattern on Clara’s arm – similar to one seen on Quen Carellon. Proceeded to subdue both half elves, killed one and took other prisoner. Tank source of sickness – Rex Sanitem clearly involved in spread, despite claiming to be ones to prevent it. Warned local line officer about plot, left Clara to her fate (disease uncurable).

Brought tied up prisoner + Torgir back on train for interrogation / curing petrified friends. Attacked by three remaining men on horses beside train in attempt to stop escape. Fought off summoned mastiff creature + halted their pursuit. Halv-Firs disguised as murdered companion of prisoner + mind reading by chronicler revealed following: Five half elves under contract given by serious looking dark haired woman (Emilia von Drek?), meeting in harbor somewhere. Possibly under threat of harm to family. Awaiting further interrogation when back in Stone-Upon-Hill.
