The Northbound Guard

Centralised regiment of the Trifectian armed forces, representing all other regiments.

Stationed in Soskni and tasked with the safekeeping of the capitol, the regiment is large and unwieldy, combining soldiers from the entire length of the Line. What the Northbound Guard lacks in general discipline it makes up for in numbers, as the centralised regiment alone almost dwarfs the entire armies of neighbouring Vergenwell and Fuhdain put together.

Other notable regiments:

Officers of the Line - Elite officers selected to serve upon the Line, ensuring the Steam Singers travel unharmed throughout Kazar
The Trifectian Naval Forces - Fledgling naval force situated south of the Gulf of Kazar, patrols the Culferani Ocean.
The Northbound Armed Engineering School - Research segment of the military, focused on developing steam powered weaponry
Keepers of the Arc - Highly trained and deadly soldiers sworn to lay down their lives for the Trifecta. Never leave Arc-upon-high
The D'Yavol - Secret police who report directly to the Trifecta themselves
