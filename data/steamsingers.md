Steam Singers

The Steam singers are the singular greatest invention since the advent of steam in the world of Kazar. Coupled with the Line, which stretches from Soskni to the Stormfyord, these wondrous contraptions have made travelling the continent a thing of great speed and ease.

Named in honour of the Bards of Anam, who once sung the Fourth Realm into existence, their wagons emblazoned with the likenes of Vallaka the Flamecaller, the Steam singers are regarded as almost miraculous creations.

They were first believed to have been invented by the halfling Gregan Stevey, who had seen how a rock had been propelled into the air by the force of steam erupting from Vallaka's Maw. His theory was put into practice in the year 11 PT, where Stevey impressed his peers by having a wagon transport a stack of wooden planks from one side of his workshop to the other, pulled by a steam powered contraption.

Stevey was, sadly, murdered shortly after and the patent spread across the entirety of Soskni, as every merchant family rushed to build their own steam engine. As this bloody battle reached the attention of the Trifecta, they realised the importance of this discovery. Using their unquestionable authority, they seized all known blueprints and put their brightest engineers to the task.

The result was the Steam singers, which through a number of iterations evolved into the massive cargo and passenger transport known by all today. The entire enterprise is run by the Trifecta Line Company, which manages all Steam singers, stations and railways.
