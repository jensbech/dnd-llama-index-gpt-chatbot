Burghoul the Wide
Crest of Burghoul the Wide

One of the Trifecta, the most powerful individuals in Kazar. A founding member alongside King Efrael and President-Elect Garold Lawson.

Burghoul the Wide is a dwarven duke, and has yet to be challenged by one of his peers for his seat on the Trifecta. The other dukes initially sent him south to Soskni on a whim following the eruption in the Gulf of Kazar, as he had been a duke of low import and regard. When he returned after having allied himself with Efrael and Lawson he efficiently divided and conquered his rivals, proving himself to be a shrewd schemer underestimated by all. His seat on the Trifecta has been secure ever since.

The dwarven kingdom of today is one in constant disarray, as the remaining dukes war against each other for control of every single newly discovered mine.
