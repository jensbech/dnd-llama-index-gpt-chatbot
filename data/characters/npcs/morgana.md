Morgana de Floc

One of the Trifecta, the most powerful individuals in Kazar. Succeeded the seat from President-Elect Garold Lawson.

Morgana de Floc (b. 7 BT) is a human merchant, descended from nobles who emigrated from Vergenwell following its independence from Fuhdain two centuries ago. According to the complex rules of the Overseer her family was considered a latecomer, therefore wielding little power in Soskni.

Her ascension to President-Elect is therefore a mystery to most. Elected for seven consecutive terms, Morgana de Floc is the undisputed ruler of the human and halfling enclaves in Soskni. She herself is often present at most gatherings, her long dark hair framing a pale, serious face which brooks no argument from her would-be rivals.

She is unmarried and has no children.
