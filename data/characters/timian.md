Timian Pestle
Wherever there is gold, there is trade. The well connected halfling Timian Pestle ensures a constant flow of goods to-and-fro the isolated fortress. He has never been seen without a smile on his face, his eyes perfectly round and slightly unnerving. Dressed in archaic fashions which reflects his peoples' ancient ties to Chytyr, he is well spoken and polite. He often invites his colleagues to visit, who in turn bring with them valuable merchandise, entertaining them in his vast hall.
Trades common resources with the workers of the Line, imports valuable goods and is always interested in purchasing items of value.
